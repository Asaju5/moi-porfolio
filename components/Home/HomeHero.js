        Hi. I'm Bamidele An aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I believe it
        becomes much easier to work in a field where work never feels like work.
        Being developer gives me that feeling. I'm always motivated to
        improve and sharpen my problem solving ability. I will love to work with a
        team of passionate and goal oriented individuals, solving real life
        problems, making the world livable to a reasonable degree.
